Can you predict the rate of vaccine acceptance in U.S. states?
There is now a vaccine for COVID-19. Acceptance of the vaccine is a key factor in the fight against COVID-19.
There is significant geographical variation in the acceptance of the vaccine. This dataset presents an opportunity
to explore potential predictors for the acceptance of the vaccine in the various states of the United States.
Data has been collected from Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s COVIDcast (https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/) project
by the Delphi research group and from the KFF (Kaiser Family Foundation)
(https://www.kff.org/statedata/custom/).
